I have done this project as part of my Web Development Internship for NeuroNexus

#TASK 1 - LANDING PAGE(Ahead-app-ug)

A landing page is an ideal web development project for beginners. It requires basic knowledge of HTML
and CSS. This project taught me to create columns, divide sections, arrange items, and add
headers and footers. The most important aspect was unleashing my creativity to design an impressive
page. I paid attention to alignments, padding, color palettes, boxes, and other elements. I had been mindful of CSS to avoid overlapping elements. In short, this landing page project has allowes me to apply HTML and CSS skills, while ensuring a visually appealing and user-friendly design.

TASK 2 - E-COMMERCE WEBSITE

I have built an e-commerce website where users can browse products, add items to a shopping cart, and
proceed to checkout. I have implemented features like user authentication, product filtering, and payment
integration using technologies like React, Node.js, and MongoDB.

I completed this project during my Web Development Internship with NeuroNexus.

**Task 1 - Landing Page (Ahead-app-ug):**  
I designed a landing page using HTML and CSS, focusing on creating columns, sections, headers, and footers. This project honed my skills in alignment, padding, color palettes, and overall design to ensure a visually appealing and user-friendly page.

**Task 2 - E-commerce Website:**  
I developed an e-commerce website featuring user authentication, product filtering, and payment integration. Using React, Node.js, and MongoDB, I enabled functionalities for browsing products, adding items to a cart, and completing the checkout process.
